## Quorum Cloud

## ⚠️ Project Deprecation Notice ⚠️

Quorum-Cloud has been deprecated, and we are no longer supporting the project.

It has been replaced by [quorum-terraform](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-terraform) and [quorum-kubernetes](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-kubernetes) that offers wider compatibility with Quorum products and cloud providers

We encourage all users with active projects to migrate to [quorum-terraform](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-terraform) or [quorum-kubernetes](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-kubernetes)

If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to the ConsenSys protocol engineering team on [#Discord](https://chat.consensys.net) or by [email](mailto:quorum@consensys.net).
